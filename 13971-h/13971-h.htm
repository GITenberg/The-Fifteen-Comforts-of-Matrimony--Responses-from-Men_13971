be scans of photocopies of a reproduction of the original text. On top
of the original's battered type-face and archaic spellings, this
preparer, and the proofreaders before him, have had to contend with
dirty or faded images and missing margins. We have made our best
guesses as to the missing letters, but in some cases we were stymied;
those few places are marked with [*?]. In addition, the most obvious
printer's mistakes (transposed, missing, obviously incorrect, and even
upside-down letters) have been corrected.]<br /><br /></p>

Did he that freedom as he ought, prefer;<br />
But the first Thing he sets his Heart upon,<br />
Is to be Married, and to be undone:<br />
On some young <i>Girl</i> he casts his wanton Eyes,<br />
And wooes her with fine Complements and Toys.<br />
But that's not all&mdash;he grows in Love at last,<br />
And is impatient till those Joys he taste:<br />
Nor do's the wishing Virgin disagree,<br />
In what she longs to taste as well as he;<br />
Married they are&mdash;no Couple for a while<br />
Enjoy such Pleasure, Fortune seems to smile:<br />
But all's a Dream, from which in time they wake,<br />
And now their Breasts of other Cares partake:<br />
She grows true Woman, sullen, proud, and high,<br />
Complains he keeps her not accordingly,<br />
To what she brought&mdash;wants This rich Thing, and That<br />
Until she runs him o'er Head and Ears in Debt,<br />
That in a Gaol he's forc'd to end his Life,<br />
The first great Comfort flowing from a Wife.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Makes her the only Heaven of his Life;<br />
Keeps her Extravagantly, Fine and Gay,<br />
And never thinks she makes too much away;<br />
The <i>Treats</i> and <i>Balls</i> she is invited to,<br />
And he good Man, consents that she shall go:<br />
Believes her Company is much desired,<br />
And's proud to think she shou'd be so admired:<br />
Until at length, by chance he finds the Truth,<br />
And catches her with some enamour'd Youth:<br />
Surpriz'd&mdash;but dare not make the Matter known,<br />
Conceals her Shame, that he may hide his own;<br />
He ever after spends an anxious Life,<br />
Heavy his Sorrow, and as Light his Wife.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Now she's grown Squeamish, such ado is kept,<br />
She e'en as peevish as an <i>Ape</i> new whipt,<br />
She pukes and whines, do's nothing but complain,<br />
And vows she'll never know the like again;<br />
But 'tis as Children promise to be good,<br />
Only remember'd while they feel the Rod.<br />
And now the look'd for time approaches nigh,<br />
And you've a thousand several Things to buy,<br />
The Twi-lights, Blankets, and the Lord knows what,<br />
To keep the Child, perhaps he never got,<br />
A noise of Bawdy Gossips in his Ears,<br />
Until his House like <i>Billings gate</i> appears,<br />
Thus amply curst, he grows discreetly dull,<br />
And from a Man of Sence, becomes a Fool.<br /><br /></td></tr>

With Care and Toil to propagate his Store,<br />
Able to keep the Wolf just from the Door;<br />
As num'rous Offspring round his Table spread;<br />
Daughters for Marriage fit, and Sons for Trades,<br />
Is Blest with Comforts of the Marriage Bed.<br />
Charges encreasing daily, and the thought<br />
Where to get Money to dispose 'em out?<br />
Or then perhaps he feels the greater Curse,<br />
The Sons turn Sots, or Fools, the Daughters worse;<br />
The Wife still teezing him to do his part,<br />

On one of Twenty, blooming as a Rose,<br />
His dry and wither'd Carkass he bestows:<br />
She jilts, intrigues, and plays upon him still,<br />
Keeps her Gallants, and Rambles at her Will;<br />
Do's nothing but her Pride and Pleasure mind,<br />
And throws his Gold like Chaff before the Wind;<br />
Until at length she beggars the old Slave,<br />
And brings his Gray-Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Governs, insults, do's what e'er she thinks fit,<br />
And he good Man, must to her Will submit;<br />
Mannages all Affairs at home, abroad,<br />
While he a Cypher seems, and stands for naught;<br />
When e'er he speaks, she snaps him, and crys,<br />
<i>Pray hold your Tongue, who was't made you so wife?<br />
You will be prating, though you nothing know:</i><br />
This he must bear, and be contented too,<br />
See his Friends slighted, and must silent be,<br />
Till Death shall from the Torment set him free.<br /><br /></td></tr>

A wedded Life&mdash;do's now in strength decrease,<br />
Nor able is to satisfie that Debt,<br />
Which Marriage claims, and Women still expect,<br />
Wherefore she now withdraws her Love and Care,<br />
Reviles, and twits him of his Slights to her;<br />
Makes it a daily Quarrel, flings and throws,<br />
And Peace is now a Stranger to his House;<br />
Nay, even his Servants, and his Children too,<br />
E'en act the same they see the Mother do,<br />
While he declining, and consumptive sits,<br />
Bears all with patience, and to all submits.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Makes Huswif'ry, and Providence her Scorn<br />
Her Maid and she must to the <i>Wells</i> repair,<br />
She is not well, and goes to take the Air:<br />
The House to Servants she entrusts at home,<br />
And down on <i>Saturday</i> her Spouse must come,<br />
And with him something very Costly bring,<br />
Or Treat her there with some nice pretty thing,<br />
She brought a Fortune, and it must be so,<br />
But home to Rack and Ruin all do's go,<br />
He sums his Gains, and finds it will not do;<br />
In that for fifteen hundred pound she brought,<br />
He'd better had a Huswife in her Smock.<br /><br /></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">Another that with Prudence, and with Cares,<br />
Has mannag'd well his Family Affairs,<br />
Govern'd his Wife and Children with that ease,<br />
Which always kept the Family in peace;<br />
His sons and Daughters educated so,<br />
None better bred, none cou'd gentiler go:<br />
The Sons are now set up to drive their Trade,<br />
The daughters married, and their Fortunes paid.<br />
One Son runs out, another takes ill ways,<br />
For which their Father's Pocket always pays;<br />
The Daughter's Husband breaks, and she must come<br />
And live a burthen on him again at home;<br />
Until the daily Cares that they impart,<br />
Break first his Substance, and then break his Heart.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Marries a Beautiful young Buxom Wife;<br />

He now Consumptive, Pale and Meagre grows,<br />
While she complaining to her Parents goes;<br />
Says <i>she can't Love him, such a one as he.</i><br />
And now desires she may live sep'rately.<br />
The poor fond Parents to him trudge in haste,<br />
And reprimand him soundly for what's past.<br />
He knows no Cause&mdash;Nor thinks he is to blame,<br />

Some hopeful Youth of Equal Worth is found,<br />
And soon his Suit with glad Success is crown'd,<br />
The Marriage Articles next agreed,<br />
And the Impostor <i>Virgin</i> sooth'd to Bed;<br />
The Am'rous <i>Bridegroom</i> on the Wanton flies,<br />
Who modestly his first Attempt denys;<br />
Again he moves her, she denys again,<br />
<i>Crys Lord I never shall endure a Man</i>:<br />
But warmer grown, he rushes on the Bride,<br />
And panting now, is but with Sighs deny'd,<br />
She yields a little to dissemble more,<br />
Knowing the part she'd acted once before:<br />
Wwhile he good Man, so pleas'd with what he'as done,<br />
Proclaims her Chastity to all the Town.<br /><br /></td></tr>

That they are ravish'd with their beautious Prize;<br />
In such a case the young unthinking Sot,<br />
Boasts what a handsome Genteel Wife he'as got,<br />
Doates on her Face, commends her Shape and Air,<br />
And thinks her Virtuous beyond compare:<br />
When all the time she plays her Pranks unknown,<br />
And with her Gallant rambles up and down;<br />
[*?]y, brings him home, while the poor Husband's sent<br />
On some Fools Errand, she has her content:<br />
At length he finds her out, but dare not speak,<br />
But bears all calmly for his Honour's sake.<br /><br /></td></tr>

And proving pregnant, reckons up the Time,<br />
Lest the Sot Husband shou'd suspect her Crime.<br />
She swallows Drugs and Poysons ev'ry day,<br />
To bring the Child before its time away;<br />
This she performs so often, and is Sick,<br />
That he at length begins to smoak the Trick;<br />

Her Bed, the meer resemblance of a Tomb,<br />
And an <i>Apothecarys</i> Shop her Room;<br />
Coughing and Spitting all the Night she lies,<br />
A very Antidote to Marriage Joys:<br />

Besides the Excessive Charge of Physick Bills,<br />
A Nurse, fine Cordials, and a hundred things,<br />
Until his Substance she to little brings,<br />

A Single Life all Honest Men despise,<br />
What greater Comfort can on Earth be found,<br />
When two True Hearts are both together Crown'd.<br />
All other Pleasures are but Pains to this,<br />
A Married Couple only, finds the Bliss.<br />
The Frowns of Fate, and other Worldly Cares,<br />
Are daily lessen'd by divided Shares.<br />

If whipping <i>Joan</i> was here alive and stout,<br />
You do deserve to be well whip'd about.<br />
Ten thousand lashes shall adorn thy Bumb,<br />
If ever such a whipping Lass should come.<br />

With bawdy Gossips, and the Lord knows what,<br />
To Name a Child the Husband never got.<br />
You call him Fool, and yet that Title claim,<br />

One minute smile, the very next a Frown,<br />

Yet even then graft <i>Horns</i> upon his Skull,<br />
Makes him a Beggar to enrich her <i>Cull</i>:<br />
She seems most fond, till she gets all the <i>Pence</i>,<br />

<p><i>I am in a little pain lest the Title shou'd give Offence to some,
whom I am unwilling to disoblige; yet I hope be more Judicious, when
they see the design will allow it both their Pardon and Approbation:
for 'tis more than a little odds, had I call'd it the Fifteen Plagues
of Whoring, whether the young Gentlemen most concerned in it, would
have given themselves the trouble to peruse it. As they are Children
in their Actions, they must be dealt with like Children, and have
their Horn-books Gi[*?]ou the back. This is all the Apology I have to
make; which I hope the Moral will explain, and supply all else that
might be said upon that Head. Among all other Debaucheries, as the
principal, and leading Vice, I shall begin with Whoring.</i><br /><br /></p>

Cuckoldom, they requested me to undertake the Performance thereof, as
having had some experience for many Years in Wives cokesing their
Husbands in the very Moment they design'd to put a pair of Antlers on
their Heads for fear of being gor'd by their Neighbours; whilst other
good Wives are as often Picking their Husband's Pockets to pay now and
then for a By-Blow: I have experienced those kind Wives too who are
commonly upon the religious Point of going to Lectures when alas they
had no other Business at Church than to meet their Gallants, who
presently coaches 'em, because they dearly love Jilting. But for
Brevity passing the several Dispositions of Men's Wives, as such as
are Melancholly many Times for a Delay or Defeat, whilst others are
preparing to make their Markets at the Play-house or Spring-Garden; or
else to the Bath, when Bathing is the least part of their Errand, I
shall draw to the Comforts which we enjoy by our Wives good Nature to
others, which to their Fancies is sweet as Muskadine and Eggs.</i><br /><br /></p>

Not all the Hurry of a Married State,<br />
Can stint her Humour, make her more Sedate.<br />
She'as all the Tricks the Devil can infuse<br />
Into her Head; her Husband to abuse.<br />
Her first attempt, when once the knot is ty'd.<br />
Is how to Govern what she cannot Guide;<br />
She flatters first, and if that chance to fail,<br />
To gain her Ends a worser Method shall.<br />
Force must (where Words have no effect) ensue,<br />
It is her Humour, and it shall be so.<br />
Thus does the fright the poor mistaken Sot,<br />
To change his Breeches for a Petticoat:<br />
If Kick'd or Buffeted, he dare not move,<br />
But thinks 'tis only tokens of her Love.<br />
What she affirms (tho' diff'rent from the Sight,<br />

Her Prentice, Bully, Stallion, Foes or Friends,<br />
No matter who, if she but gain her Ends:<br />
While he's the very Subject of her Scorns,<br />
And sounds himself a Cuckold with his Horns:<br />
Yet she's so cunning, that she rails at Evil,<br />
And says, she hates a Harlot as the Devil.<br />
So have I heard a Pulpit Hector rant<br />
At Drunkenness, as zealous as a Saint,<br />
Curse it to Hell, with trembling and with fear,<br />
Tho' 'twas a Vice he seldom cou'd forbear.<br />

Tho' it was gotten by the Lord knows who.<br />

Given to lie, but seldom lying still.<br />

And if he blames her, thus for staying late,<br />
He is in danger of a broken Pate.<br />
So that he's forc'd to stay at home to Rock,<br />

This course of Life for many years she leads.<br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
